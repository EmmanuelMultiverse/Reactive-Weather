# Reactive Weather ☀️

A new startup, Reactive weather, has hired you to build a web application that renders real time weather data for cities around the world. This project will require that you utilize:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Conditional Rendering
- Controlled Inputs
- `fetch` and the `useEffect` Hook

## Part 1: React Components and Props

**GOAL**: An array of weather data has been provided for you in `data.js`. Render a `WeatherCard` in `App.js` for each city in the array and render the data for each city in the `WeatherCard`.

![Part 1 Exemplar](./exemplars/Part1Exemplar.png)

1. In the root directory, run the following to preview the app. This will refresh every time you save a file. 
    ```shell
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    Note: If you get a parcel error in the browser console upon running, try the following commands to reinstall parcel and start the app. Be sure to delete any generated directories before installing dependencies (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.parcel-cache`, `package-lock.json`)
    ```
    npm uninstall parcel
    npm install parcel@2.8.3
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
2. In `WeatherCard.js`, a card has been made for you, but hasn't been exported. Export the card using `module.exports`.
3. In `App.js`, import:
    - The `cities` array from `data.js`.
    - The `WeatherCard` from `/components/WeatherCard.js`.
4. Inside the `<div className = "app">`, use a `map()` function to iterate through the cities array and return a `WeatherCard` component for each item in the array. Each `WeatherCard` component should receive the corresponding object with a key of data.
5. In `components/WeatherCard.js`, update the `function WeatherCard` with a `props` parameter.
6. Update the `WeatherCard` so that it renders the:
    - City name
    - Temperature
    - Forecasted weather conditions

## Part 2: React State and Conditional Rendering

**GOAL**: Complete the following using your knowledge of state and conditional rendering:
- Adjust the icons to render based on the value stored in forecast (e.g. if it is rainy the rainy icon will render).
- Create a myLocation component to track the users current location and stores the value in state. This component will update with the weather for the users specific location. We will dynamically update this in future sections!

**In `components/WeatherCard.js`**:
1. There are three additional weather icons available in the `assets` folder. Import these at the top of the file just like the `sunny` icon.
2. Conditionally render the icons based on the value stored in `props.data.forecast`. E.g. If it is "Rainy" than the rainy icon should render. There are multiple ways in which to achieve this output!

**In `App.js`**:
> We will be updating this state variable in Part 3. Today we are just working on setting up the functionality for hard coded state values.
1. At the top of the file, import `useState` from the React library.
2. Create a new state variable called `location` and state setter function. Initialize it with a value for the city of your choice.
3. In the `components` folder, create a `Location.js` file. Import this into `App.js`.
4. Pass the `data`, `location`, and state setter function as props to the `Location` component.

**In `components/Location.js`**:
1. We need to search the `data` array passed as a prop to find the object that has the city that matches our `location` state. Explore how to use [`.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) to achieve this.
2. Once you have found the corresponding data, return a card similar to the one in `WeatherCard.js`. It can look similar to the card below.
    - **NOTE**: It may help to turn the icon conditional rendering you wrote into a helper function and import it into this component so that you can use DRY principles.

## Part 3: Controlled Inputs

**GOAL**: Create a `Form` component that allows users to input their city and the program will output either:
1. The weather for the city they input
2. Some message informing the user that city is not in the array.

![Part 3 Exemplar](./exemplars/Part3Exempalr.gif) 

**In `App.js`**:
1. In the `components` folder, create a `Form.js` file. Import this into `App.js`.
2. Render the `Form` component near the top of your application. Pass it the `location` state and `setLocation` state setter function as props.

**In `components/Form.js`**:
1. Destructure the `location` and `setLocation` props.
2. Return a `<form>` element that has an `<input>` element that will accept a city input and `<button>` element. Feel free to create your own or you can use the template code below:

    ```jsx
    <div className = "form">
        <form>
            <label className = "city">City:
                <input type="text"/>
            </label>
            <button 
                className = "btn btn-primary" 
                type="submit"
            >Submit</button>
        </form>
    </div>
    ```

3. Assign the `<input>` a value of `location` and create an `onChange` event handler that sets the `location` to the current value of the `<input>` using `e.target.value`.

> Try out your form. Oh no! There's an error. Why? Currently the location state is updating every time you type and this is causing the application to error out.

4. Import `useState` from the React library.
5. Create a new piece of state called `typedLocation` and a state setter function. Initialize it as an empty string.
6. Update the `<input>` value as `typedLocation`. Update the `onChange` event handler to set `typedLocation` to the current value of `<input>` using `e.target.value`.
7. Create a `handleSubmit` function that does the following:
    - Accept the event as a parameter
    - Prevent the default form behavior using `e.preventDefault()`.
    - Call `setLocation` and pass it the current value of `typedLocation`.
    - Reset `typedLocation` to an empty string using the state setter function.
8. In the `<form>` opening tag, create an `onSubmit` event handler and pass it the `handleSubmit` function. 
9. Try out the form! It should work for any city in the array and should throw an error if you type a city that doesn't match.

**In components/Location.js**:

The user may submit a location that isn't in the array, we want to make sure that the program can handle this.
1. If the location is not found in the `data` array, render a message to the user like `"Location not found"` or something similar.
2. Try submitting an incorrect location to verify that your application can handle this input.

## Part 4: `useEffect` and `fetch`

We want users to be able to search **ANY** location, not just some hard coded data. Luckily, there are many weather APIs we can hook up to our application! Explore the following APIs and decide which one works best for you:
- [Open Metro](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) - No API Key required, buy you will need to figure out how to convert locations into coordinates.
- [AccuWeather](https://developer.accuweather.com/) - API Key required. Make sure to use a `.env` and the `dotenv` package to read environment variables.
- Any other free weather API you can find. Here's a full list of [free weather APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather)

This is fairly open ended based on the API you select, but a few things to consider trying.
1. Select a Weather API from the options above. Explore the documentation for how to access the endpoint and the structure of the data that is returned.
2. Update the `Location` component with a call that initiates a `fetch` call to your endpoint(s) every time the `location` state is updated.
    - **NOTE**: You can add a variable to your dependency array for `useEffect` so that it runs only when that variable is updated.
    ```js
    useEffect(() => {
        // DO SOMETHING
    }, [updatedVariable]) // useEffect only runs when updatedVariable changes.
    ```
3. Most of the APIs will require you to either provide coordinate points and/or city IDs in order to Based on the user input, render a 1 day, 5 day, or 10 day forecast.
4. Allow the user to specify if they want different information like Celsius vs. Fahrenheit or the amount of precipitation. Customize the outputs to respond to these inputs.
